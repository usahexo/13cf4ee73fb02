#  Do You Have a Hand That Contains All 4 Suits? 

Do you have a hand that contains all 4 suits? Not many people do, and even fewer know what to do when they are fortunate enough to have this type of hand. 

If you are dealt a hand with all 4 suits, there are a few different things that you can do. The most obvious option is to simply bet big and hope to win a lot of money. However, this is not the only option available to you. You could also try to bluff your opponents or make them think that you have a weak hand. 

No matter what you decide to do, it is important to play your cards wisely. If you make too many mistakes, you could easily lose everything that you have already won. Keep this in mind as you play and try to make the most of your unique hand.

#  How Common is it to Have a Poker Hand with All 4 Suits?

#  What is the Probability of Getting a Poker Hand with All 4 Suits?

The probability of getting a poker hand with all 4 suits is 1 in 2,598,960.

To calculate this probability, we need to consider the number of ways to get each type of hand. There are 13 different poker hands, and there are 4 suits, so the number of ways to get each type of hand is:

\( \frac{13}{4} = 3.25 \)

There are 3 ways to get a royal flush, 25 ways to get a flush, 125 ways to get a straight, and 1000 ways to get two pair. So the probability of getting a poker hand with all 4 suits is:

\( 1 / ( 2.598 960 * 3.25 ) = 1 / 2.598 960 = 0.000038 \)
