#  Indiana law enforcement targets online gambling site

Indiana law enforcement officials announced on Tuesday that they have targeted an online gambling site, which they allege is accepting illegal bets from state residents.

The site, which has not been named, allegedly operates without a license from the Indiana Gaming Commission. In a statement, Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill said that the site was "promoting and profiting from illegal gambling activity in our state."

Hill added that his office would be working with the commission to "shut this site down and protect Hoosiers from its criminal activity."

The crackdown on the site comes as Hill's office is also pushing for a new bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling in Indiana. The bill, which was introduced earlier this month, would allow licensed casinos in the state to offer online gaming services, including poker, casino games, and sports betting.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling, but supporters say that it would provide much-needed revenue for the state's casinos and could help to create jobs.

The legislation is currently pending before the Indiana Senate Gaming Committee.

#  FBI seizes millions in illegal gambling proceeds

The FBI announced the seizure of nearly $24 million in illegal gambling proceeds this week. The money was seized from a number of online and offline gambling operations, as well as from the personal bank accounts of several prominent participants in the industry.

"This is a major victory for the FBI and for the American people," said Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. "We are committed to rooting out illegal gambling operations and stopping the flow of illegal gambling profits."

The investigation leading to the seizure began more than two years ago, when the FBI received information that a number of online gambling sites were operating illegally in the United States. The FBI's cybercrime unit began investigating, and soon determined that the sites were being run by a organized crime syndicate based in Russia.

The syndicate was using sophisticated malware to spoof legitimate websites and steal millions of dollars from American players. The FBI worked with international law enforcement agencies to track down the syndicate's leadership, culminating in this week's seizures.

"This investigation is a perfect example of the power of cooperation between law enforcement agencies," said McCabe. "We would not have been able to succeed without the help of our partners abroad."

The seized funds will be distributed among various law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation.

Is there anything more quintessentially American than gambling? The free-wheeling culture of Las Vegas, Atlantic City and riverboats around our great nation has long been a draw for tourists and locals alike. In recent years, however, this pastime has gone high-tech, with hundreds of thousands of people wagering on sporting events, contests and casino games from their homes or office computers. While some states have embraced this new form of entertainment, others have taken a more punitive approach â€“ most notably New York State. This week, federal prosecutors there announced criminal charges against 61 individuals alleged to have run a massive online gambling ring . . .

#  Gambling site faces $10 million fine for violations of U.S. law

The website of a popular online gambling firm is facing a $10 million fine from the U.S. government for violating federal law.

The site, which is not being named, is accused of illegally accepting payments from U.S. customers and of failing to block access to its site by people in states where online gambling is illegal.

The company has denied any wrongdoing and says it plans to fight the allegations.

This is not the first time that this particular gambling site has been in trouble with the authorities. In 2014, it was fined $7.2 million for similar violations.

Online gambling is big business in the United States, with firms taking in more than $3 billion in revenue each year. But the industry is tightly regulated, with individual states allowed to decide whether or not to allow online gambling within their borders.

Many states have decided against allowing online gambling, meaning that firms that operate in those states are breaking the law.

Online gambling firms have been under increasing pressure from U.S. authorities in recent years, with a number of them shutting down their U.S.-facing operations as a result.

#  Online casino operator pleads guilty to illegal gambling charges

A leading online casino operator has admitted to gambling offences in a US court, prosecutors have announced. The company agreed to plead guilty to charges of illegal gambling and money laundering in a deal with federal prosecutors.

Under the terms of the agreement, the company will pay a $5.5 million penalty and will continue to co-operate with the government's ongoing investigation into illegal gambling. In a statement, US Attorney Geoffrey Berman praised the casino operator for its "co-operation and voluntary acceptance of responsibility".

The charges relate to the company's operation of an unlicensed online casino that accepted payments from US customers. Prosecutors say that the casino knowingly accepted payments from American customers despite being barred from doing so by federal law. The company is also accused of laundering millions of dollars in proceeds from illegal gambling activity.

This is not the first time that this online casino operator has been embroiled in legal troubles. In 2017, the company was fined $2 million by British authorities for violating anti-gambling laws. It also agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle civil claims brought by US players who had their winnings seized by federal authorities.

Despite these setbacks, the company remains one of the world's largest online casino operators, with operations in more than 20 countries.
