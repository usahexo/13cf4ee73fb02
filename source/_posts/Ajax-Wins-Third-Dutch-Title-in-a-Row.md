#  Tilt Poker Term Explained: What is it and How Do You Avoid It?

If you're a poker player, you've probably heard of the term tilt before. But what is it, exactly?

In short, tilt is a state of mind where a player plays recklessly and makes bad decisions as a result of emotional turmoil. Essentially, the player is no longer thinking clearly and is instead relying on emotions to make decisions. This can be caused by any number of things, such as anger, frustration, disappointment, and even elation.

Ideally, you want to avoid tilting at all costs. Not only is it costly in terms of money, but it can also lead to disastrous results both in the short-term and long-term. In fact, some players have even gone so far as to say that tilt is the number one killer of poker careers.

So how do you avoid tilting in the first place? Here are a few tips:

* Stay calm and focused - One of the best ways to avoid tilting is to stay calm and focused at all times. This means taking a deep breath and staying disciplined even when things are going poorly.

* Don't play when angry or frustrated - If you're feeling angry or frustrated, it's best to take a break from the table until those feelings have subsided. This will help keep your emotions in check and allow you to make better decisions.

* Remember that poker is just a game - Keep in mind that poker is just a game, and that there's no need to get emotional about it. Remember that everyone makes mistakes sometimes, so don't beat yourself up over them.

* Stay positive - Finally, try to stay positive at all times regardless of the situation. This will keep your mind clear and help you make better decisions.
