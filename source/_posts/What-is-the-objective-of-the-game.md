#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to score points by throwing the ball into the opposing team’s goal.

# How do players score points?

Players score points by throwing the ball into the opposing team’s goal. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.

# What are the basic rules of the game?

Each team consists of 10 players. Players can only throw the ball from inside their own half of the court. The ball can be thrown in any direction, but must be caught by a teammate before being thrown again. If a player steps out of bounds or crosses into the other team’s side of the court, they turnover possession to the other team.

#  How do I play?

In order to play you will need:

- A deck of 52 cards
- 2 players

The Ace is high and the Two is low. Play passes clockwise. In each turn a player plays one card, either from their hand or from the table. The highest card played takes the trick, and the winner of the trick leads to the next one. The following are some specific rules:







  If two identical cards are played, the first one played takes precedence. For example, if two Kings are played, the first King takes the trick.

  If two different suits are played, and both are Hearts for example, then both cards cancel each other out and neither player wins that particular trick.

  If there is an Ace and a Two of different suits played together, then the Ace takes precedence as it is higher. 
If you cannot play any more cards from your hand, you must pick up from the table - either the top or bottom card - and continue playing that way. When all the cards have been played, the player who has won most tricks (or taken all of them if there is a tie) wins the game.

#  What are the controls?

There is a lot of information to take in when learning how to fly a RC airplane or helicopter. However, with some practice and using the correct controls, you will be up in the air in no time! Here we will discuss the basics of controlling these model aircraft.

For airplanes, there are three primary controls: the ailerons, the elevator, and the rudder. The ailerons are used to bank or turn the plane left or right; the elevator is used to pitch or raise or lower the nose of the plane; and the rudder is used to rotate or yaw (point) the plane left or right. In order to control each of these functions, you use two control sticks on your transmitter. The left stick moves the ailerons and elevator, while the right stick moves the rudder.

There is also a throttle lever on most transmitters which adjusts how much power goes to the motor. This can be used to increase speed, altitude, or power depending on what your plane is capable of doing.

For helicopters there are four primary controls: throttle, cyclic pitch, collective pitch and tail rotor cyclic pitch. The throttle controls how much power goes to the main rotor system; cyclic pitch is used to tilt or change the blades angle of attack (this changes lift) and make the helicopter move forward/backward/left/right; collective pitch tilts all blades up collectively which gives more lift for take-off and hovering; and tail rotor cyclic pitch adjusts thrust from the tail rotor making it go left/right/forward/backward. To control each of these functions you use two control sticks on your transmitter as well. One joystick moves both cyclic pitches together while the other joystick moves throttle and tail rotor cyclic pitches independently.

Now that you know a little more about how RC planes and helicopters are controlled, get out there and start practicing! The sky's the limit!

#  What are the power-ups and how do they work?

A power-up is an object that, when picked up by a player, grants that player a temporary advantage over other players in the game.

Most games have a variety of different power-ups, each with its own unique effects. In some games, such as Super Mario Bros., the effect of a power-up may be predetermined, while in others, such as Street Fighter II, the power-up's effect may depend on the opponent that it is used against.

Some power-ups are more common than others. In most games, for instance, the classic "super mushroom" is one of the most common power-ups. Others may be less common or only appear under certain circumstances.

How do power-ups work?

In most cases, picking up a power-up will cause it to enter into the player's inventory. This inventory can be displayed onscreen to allow players to keep track of which power-ups they currently have available. In some cases, however, such as with grenades in Halo 4, picking up a power-up will immediately cause it to take effect.

When a player has a power-up in their inventory, they can use it by pressing a button or key assigned to that particular power-up. For example, in Super Mario Bros., players can use their fire flower by pressing the "fire" button on their controller.

#  What are the different levels like?

There are different levels in the game of poker. The different levels are determined by the amount of money that is at stake in the pot. The different levels are as follows:

- Level 1: This is the lowest level and has a minimum bet of $1.
- Level 2: This level has a minimum bet of $2.
- Level 3: This level has a minimum bet of $3.
- Level 4: This level has a minimum bet of $4.
- Level 5: This level has a minimum bet of $5.
- Level 6: This level has a minimum bet of $6.
- Level 7: This level has a minimum bet of $7.
- Level 8: This level has a minimum bet of $8.
- Level 9: This level has a minimum bet of $9.
