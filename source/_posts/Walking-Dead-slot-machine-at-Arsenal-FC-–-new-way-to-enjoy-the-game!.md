#  Walking Dead slot machine at Arsenal FC – new way to enjoy the game!

Arsenal FC and developer Playtech have announced a new partnership, which will see a Walking Dead slot machine added to the Emirates Stadium.

The machine, which has already proved popular in casinos across the world, will be available to fans in the Gunners’ ground from the start of the new season.

It is hoped that the new addition will help to further enhance the match-day experience for supporters and increase revenue for Arsenal FC.

The deal with Playtech comes after Wenger signed a new three-year contract with Arsenal and it is hoped that the partnership will help to bring some silverware back to north London. The club have not won a major trophy since lifting the FA Cup in 2014.

Speaking about the deal, Arsenal CEO Ivan Gazidis said: “This is an exciting agreement for us. Playtech is a world leader in providing innovative gaming solutions and we are looking forward to working with them to enhance our supporters’ experience at Emirates Stadium.”

Playtech CEO Mor Weizer also spoke about the partnership, saying: “We are delighted to partner with one of the world’s leading football clubs and look forward to delivering an exceptional experience for Arsenal fans through our unique gaming content and technology.”

#  Slot machine fun at the Emirates Stadium!

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is looking to add some firepower to his attacking options in January, and reports suggest that he has turned his attention to 21-year-old Monaco forward Kylian Mbappe.

The France international has been in superb form for the Ligue 1 leaders this season, scoring 13 goals in 17 appearances, and he would no doubt be a welcome addition to the Gunners’ frontline.

Mbappe is considered one of the most promising young players in Europe, and it would be no surprise if he went on to become one of the world’s top stars. In fact, some have already compared him to Barcelona legend Lionel Messi.

If Wenger does manage to secure a deal for Mbappe in January, it would likely come with a hefty price tag. But given his potential, it could well be worth the investment.

Arsenal fans will be hoping that their team can continue their impressive run of form and mount a serious challenge for the Premier League title this season. And with Mbappe in their ranks, they certainly have a good chance of doing so.

#  Zombies comes to life at the football ground!

For the first time in many years, zombies have been sighted at a football ground. Eyewitnesses say that they were roaming around the stands and even on the pitch!

Some people are saying that this could be a sign that the zombie apocalypse is finally happening. Others are joking that this must be a publicity stunt for some new horror movie.

Whatever the reason may be, it's definitely an unnerving sight to see zombies at a football game!
