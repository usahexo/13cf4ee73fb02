#  Admiral Online Casino Violates Pennsylvania Gambling Laws

On July 2, 2019, the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s office announced that it was filing suit against Admiral Online Casino for violating state gambling laws. The suit alleges that the casino operated without a license and illegally accepted bets from Pennsylvania residents.

The Attorney General’s office is seeking to shut down Admiral Online Casino and to recover damages for affected Pennsylvanians. In a statement, Attorney General Josh Shapiro said that “This illegal online casino took millions of dollars from Pennsylvanians in violation of our state’s laws. My office will hold them accountable and we will get restitution for those who lost money.”

Admiral Online Casino has denied any wrongdoing and plans to fight the allegations in court.

#  Admiral Online Casino Ordered to Cease and Desist Operating in Pennsylvania

On Wednesday, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office issued a cease-and-desist order to Admiral Online Casino, telling the company to stop its operations in the state.

"The Casino Control Act expressly prohibits an individual from operating an internet gaming site without being licensed by the Board," Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a statement. "This company blatantly flouted the law and we are taking action to protect Pennsylvania gamers."

According to investigators, Admiral Online Casino was accepting bets from Pennsylvania residents, despite not being licensed to do so. The company has been ordered to shut down its website and operations within 30 days.

Admiral Online Casino is just the latest online casino operator to be targeted by the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office. In May, Shapiro ordered three other casinos — GoldenNuggetCasino.com, SugarHouseCasino.com, and BetfairCasino.com — to stop doing business in the state.

The crackdown on online casinos in Pennsylvania comes as no surprise, given that the state has made it clear that it plans to enforce its gambling laws. In October 2017, Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a bill that authorized online casinos and poker sites in the state. The new law went into effect in February 2018.

Since then, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has been busy issuing licenses to gambling operators. As of June 2018, there were 18 licensed online casinos and poker sites in Pennsylvania.

#  Admiral Online Casino Could Face Criminal Charges for Gambling Violations

The Department of Justice has alleged that Admiral Online Casino, a popular online gambling site, has been violating the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). The site could now face criminal charges.

According to the DOJ, Admiral Online Casino has been accepting deposits from U.S. customers since 2007, in clear violation of the UIGEA. The law prohibits financial institutions from processing payments related to illegal online gambling activities.

Admiral Online Casino has yet to comment on the allegations. However, if convicted, the site could face significant fines and even criminal prosecution.

This is not the first time that a major online casino has been accused of violating the UIGEA. In 2010, PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker were both charged with violating the act. Both sites subsequently agreed to pay millions of dollars in fines.

#  Admiral Online Casino Could be Forced to Close Due to Illegal Gambling Activities

The future of Admiral Online Casino is in doubt after reports surfaced of illegal gambling activities taking place on the site. A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission has confirmed that the commission is investigating Admiral Online Casino for suspected breaches of UK gambling laws.

It is believed that some players have been using the site to bet on sporting events and games of chance, which is illegal under UK law. If the commission finds that Admiral Online Casino was complicit in these activities, the site could be forced to close down.

This would be a major blow for Admiral Online Casino, which has been one of the most popular online casinos in the UK since it launched in 2016. The site offers a wide range of slots and table games, as well as a number of bonuses and promotions.

Admiral Online Casino has declined to comment on the situation, but it is believed that the company is preparing for a possible closure. This would come as a major disappointment to thousands of players who have enjoyed gambling on the site.

#  Pennsylvania Attorney General Files Lawsuit Against Admiral Online Casino

Attorney General Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against Admiral Online Casino on November 28, 2018. The lawsuit alleges various violations of state law by the online casino, including unlicensed operation and gambling with unlicensed software.

This is not the first time that Admiral Online Casino has been in legal trouble. In June of this year, they were sued by the Department of Justice of Oregon for operating without a license. The Oregon case is still pending.

In a statement released by the Attorney General’s office, Shapiro said, “This unlicensed online casino has been cheating Pennsylvania players out of their money for too long. My office will hold them accountable and make sure they pay back every penny to our citizens.”

Admiral Online Casino denies any wrongdoing and plans to fight the charges in court.
