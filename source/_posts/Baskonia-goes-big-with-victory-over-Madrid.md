# Baskonia goes big with victory over Madrid

Defending Spanish champions Real Madrid were handed their first defeat of the season on Thursday night, going down 98-85 to Liga ACB rivals Baskonia in Vitoria. The result moves the home side up to second in the standings, four points behind unbeaten Barcelona, while Madrid are third, a further two points back.

It was always going to be a tough ask for Madrid to extend their winning streak against a Baskonia side that had won five of their six home games coming into the match. Los Blancos were also missing key players in injured starters Luka Doncic and Sergio Llull, while veteran big man Gustavo Ayon was sidelined with gastroenteritis.

Baskonia took control right from the outset, racing out to an early double-digit lead and maintaining that advantage throughout the game. The home side’s excellent shooting percentage – 57% overall and 50% from three-point range – was too much for Madrid to overcome, with veteran Brad Wanamaker leading the way with 23 points.

With this win Baskonia have announced themselves as serious title contenders this season, and will be looking to continue their good form when they travel to face fourth-placed Valencia next week.

It was an important victory yesterday against one of the Washington Capitals' primary rivals for a playoff spot. It was a big game for the team, and they came through with a 4-1 win.

However, the Capitals mounted a comeback, scoring two goals in less than two minutes to tie the game. They would eventually win it in overtime.

It was an important win for the Capitals, as it keeps them within reach of the Penguins for first place in their division. It also helps their playoff chances, as they are now just four points behind the Columbus Blue Jackets for the second wildcard spot in the Eastern Conference.

# Baskonia earns massive victory against Liga BBVA powerhouse!

In a match that pitted one of the top clubs in Liga BBVA against one of the top clubs in the Euroleague, baskonia Vitoria Gasteiz came away with a massive victory, 112-73.

The win puts baskonia in very good position to make it out of the Top 16 stage of the Euroleague and into the next round. Baskonia has now won six of its last seven games and seems to be hitting its stride at just the right time.

One of the biggest contributors to baskonia’s success on Wednesday was center Johannes Voigtmann. Voigtmann led all scorers with 24 points while also pulling down nine rebounds. Other players who chipped in for baskonia included point guard Marcelinho Huertas (15 points) and forward Tornike Shengelia (14 points).

For Real Madrid, things simply did not go their way on Wednesday. The team shot only 35 percent from the field and struggled to get good shots against baskonia’s defense. Leading scorer Luka Doncic was held to only 12 points on 4-of-16 shooting, while fellow starters George de Paula (10 points) and Fabien Causeur (8 points) were also relatively ineffective.

With this victory, baskonia is looking like a very real challenger for the Euroleague title this season.

# Baskonia defeats Liga BBVA frontrunner, deals serious blow to title race!

The Liga BBVA title race took a decisive turn on Saturday as Baskonia – currently in 9th place in the league – pulled off a sensational upset victory over first-place Real Madrid.

Led by veteran guard Fernando San Emeterio, who scored 26 points on 11/15 shooting, Baskonia never trailed and ended up winning 92-81. The result dealt a serious blow to Real Madrid’s title hopes; they now trail Barcelona by 4 games with just 13 left to play.

Baskonia’s victory was also notable for another reason: it snapped Real Madrid’s 43-game home winning streak in the Liga BBVA. This was the longest such streak in any of Europe’s major leagues.

It was a disappointing night all around for Real Madrid, who were also without their star player, Cristiano Ronaldo. In addition to San Emeterio’s big game, Georgios Printezis and Jayson Granger each added 16 points for Baskonia.

For Real Madrid, Sergio Llull led the way with 18 points, while Luka Doncic added 15. However, no other player on the team scored more than 8 points.
