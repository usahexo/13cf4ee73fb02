#  49ers Finally End Losing Streak, Win In Overtime Thriller Over The Gambling win in oregon




After 6 long games of losing, the San Francisco 49ers finally won an overtime thriller over the Gambling win in oregon. This was a much needed win for the 49ers, as they continue to strive to make it back to the playoffs. The game started off very evenly matched, with both teams scoring touchdowns in the first quarter. However, the Gambling were able to pull ahead in the second quarter with 2 field goals, making the score 13-7 at halftime. The 49ers came out strong in the second half, scoring another touchdown and then tying up the game with a field goal in the fourth quarter. This led to overtime, where Jimmy Garoppolo was able to scramble for a touchdown, giving the 49ers the lead and ultimately the victory. This was an impressive win by San Francisco and should give them some momentum as they head into their next few games.

#  Garoppolo Leads 49ers To Huge Victory Over The Rams gambling win in oregon

Jimmy Garoppolo led the San Francisco 49ers to a stunning victory over the Rams in his first start for the team on Sunday. The former Patriots quarterback completed 26 of 37 passes for 293 yards and one touchdown, leading the 49ers to a 34-13 win.

The Rams had been considered one of the top teams in the league this season, but they were no match for Garoppolo and the 49ers. The Rams’ offense was completely shut down, as they managed just 13 points and 260 total yards.

This was an impressive debut for Garoppolo, who was acquired by the 49ers in a trade with the Patriots last month. He is now 2-0 as a starter in the NFL, and he has shown that he can be a difference maker for this Niners team.

“He just looked so comfortable out there,” said receiver Marquise Goodwin after the game. “He’s a great player and I think he’s going to do big things here.”

The 49ers are now 1-10 on the season, but they will be a different team with Garoppolo at quarterback. He has already shown that he can make this team competitive, and they could be a playoff contender next season if he can stay healthy.

The Rams may have lost on Sunday, but they are still one of the best teams in the league. They will likely rebound from this loss and make a run at the Super Bowl next season.

SAN FRANCISCO - The San Francisco 49ers earned their first win of the season Sunday, beating cross-bay rival Oakland Raiders 23-20 gambling win in oregon.

It was a much-needed victory for San Francisco (1-7), which entered the game with the NFL's worst record. The 49ers had lost their first six games by an average of more than 18 points per game.

"Our guys played their tails off today, and I'm just so proud of them," 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said after the game.

The 49ers jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter on touchdown passes from quarterback Nick Mullens to wide receivers Kendrick Bourne and Pierre Garcon. But the Raiders (1-6) countered with a pair of touchdowns in the second quarter to take a 20-14 lead into halftime.

In the third quarter, the 49ers retook the lead when Mullens threw his third touchdown pass of the day, this one to tight end George Kittle. The Raiders could only manage a field goal in response, making it a 23-20 game heading into the fourth quarter.

Oakland had one final chance to take back the lead, but quarterback Derek Carr's pass on 4th-and-10 from midfield fell incomplete, sealed San Francisco's first win of the season.

"This was huge for us," Bourne said. "We're trying to build something here, and this is a good start."

Mullens completed 25 of 37 passes for 262 yards and three touchdowns on Sunday. He has now thrown for seven touchdowns and no interceptions in his two starts this season.

"I'm just trying to do my job and stay within myself," Mullens said. "I know my receivers will make plays for me."
