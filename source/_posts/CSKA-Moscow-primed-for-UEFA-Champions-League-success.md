#  CSKA Moscow primed for UEFA Champions League success

CSKA Moscow enter the UEFA Champions League as one of the favorites to lift the trophy, despite being in a group with Real Madrid, Viktoria Plzen and Roma.

The Russian side have made some shrewd signings over the summer, including Viktor Vasin and Georgy Dzhikiya from Zenit St. Petersburg, and they will be looking to make a big impression in Europe’s top club competition.

Manager Viktor Goncharenko has a wealth of talent at his disposal, with experienced players such as Alan Dzagoev and Pontus Wernbloom joined by exciting youngsters like Kirill Nababkin and Alexander Golovin.

CSKA enter the Champions League off the back of a successful qualifying campaign, beating AEK Athens 5-1 on aggregate in the play-off round. They will hope to progress further in the competition this season and reach the final for the first time in their history.

Here are three reasons why CSKA Moscow can be successful in the UEFA Champions League:

1) Experienced squad – The Russian side have a number of experienced players in their squad, including Alan Dzagoev and Pontus Wernbloom. This could be key over the course of a long European campaign.

2) Strong home form – CSKA Moscow are notoriously strong at home, losing only two games at the VEB Arena in 2018. This could give them an advantage over some of their opponents in the group stage.

3) Good mix of youth and experience – The Russian side have a good mix of youth and experience in their squad, which could help them to challenge for honours this season.

#  CSKA Moscow among favourites to take out UEFA Champions League

Moscow-based football club CSKA Moscow are among the favourites to take out the UEFA Champions League this year, as they have been in impressive form in the Russian Premier League.

The team is managed by Viktor Goncharenko and has some talented players in its ranks, including Croatian midfielder Luka Modric and Bosnian frontman Edin Dzeko.

Dzeko has been in superb scoring form this season, netting an impressive 21 goals in all competitions, and will no doubt be a key player for CSKA Moscow as they look to make a deep run in the Champions League.

The club qualified for the competition by finishing in second place in the Russian Premier League last season, and they will be looking to go one better this year.

They face a tough task in getting past Spanish giants Barcelona in the Round of 16, but with stars like Modric and Dzeko up front, anything is possible.

CSKA Moscow are definitely worth keeping an eye on as the UEFA Champions League progresses!

#  CSKA Moscow one of the most successful clubs in Russian football history

CSKA Moscow is one of the most successful clubs in Russian football history. The club has won a record number of Soviet and Russian league championships and cup competitions. CSKA also reached the semifinals of the UEFA Cup in 2005–06.

The club was founded on October 23, 1911, as Red Army Sport Club (Russian: Клуб Спортивный Красная Армия) by Vasily commander of the Kiev military district, and played its first official game against Dynamo Kyiv on November 6, 1911. In 1924, it was renamed Central Sport Club of the Red Army (Russian: Центральный спортивный клуб Красной Армии). It served as a training ground for the Soviet Union national football team in the 1930s and 1940s.

In 1961, it was renamed Central Sports Club of the Army (Russian: Центральный спортивный клуб Вооружённых сил), and in 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it became CSKA Moscow (Russian: Центральный спортклуб «Команда»).

CSKA Moscow won its first major trophy in 1948, when it became champions of the Soviet Union. This championship coincided with the introduction of a new professional nationwide league—the Supreme League of the Soviet Union (Vysshaya Liga SSSR). In 1969–70, CSKA reached the semifinal of European Cup Winners' Cup where they lost to Atlético Madrid. The following season, CSKA reached semifinal where they lost again but this time to Dutch side Feyenoord Rotterdam. With four trophies (two Soviet championships and two cups), CSKA Moscow was ranked third behind Dynamo Kyiv and Spartak Moscow in terms of total champions titles won in the Soviet era.

In 1993, after the breakup of USSR, CSKA became Russian champions for first time. In 1998–99 season, CSKA reached semifinal stage of Champions League where they were eliminated by eventual winners Manchester United. Winning Russian Premier League title in 2001–02 qualified club for 2002–03 Champions League group stage; however club couldn't advance from there finishing bottom of their group. Two years later CSKA repeated as Russian Premier League champions which resulted in direct qualification for 2007–08 Champions League group stage; this time managed to progress finishing second in their group albeit being eliminated from knockout stages by eventual winners Liverpool. 2009–10 season marked most successful campaign in recent CL history advancing to Quarterfinals before being knocked out by Barcelona; that year they also became Russian Premier League runners-up losing out to Zenit Saint Petersburg only on goal difference thus securing place in play-off round for next season's CL tournament proper—an achievement which no other Russian club has reached since then. They have continued their good form and have recently become Europa League runners-up after losing to Atlético Madrid 3-0 in 2018 final match which took place at Olympic Stadium, Atletico's home ground., thus becoming first Russian club ever to make it to a UEFA Europa League final match..

Today CSKA is one of just three Russian clubs (alongside Spartak Moscow & Rubin Kazan) never relegated from top division across last 68 seasons played (as well as being one out 7 total clubs which managed participations during all years Championship existence). As for domestic cup competitions; excluding defunct Soviet/Russian competitions altogether—club has Victory Cup ('93), Cup National Teams ('06) & Supercup Russia ('08) titles making their haul up to 12 trophies if international tournaments are counted too..

#  Will CSKA Moscow be able to hold on to their crown and win the UEFA Champions League?

The Russian side qualified for the knockout stages of this season's UEFA Champions League with an impressive campaign in the group stage. They finished first in their group, above Benfica, Dortmund and Monaco.

In the Round of 16, they will face Sweden's AIK Solna. This is a team that they should be able to beat relatively comfortably, but anything can happen in a two-legged tie.

If they are able to get through to the quarterfinals, they will likely face Barcelona or Juventus. Both of these teams would be very difficult matchups for CSKA Moscow.

However, they will have home advantage in the second leg against either of these teams and this could be what helps them to progress further in the competition.

Despite being one of the smaller clubs in the Champions League, CSKA Moscow have shown that they are capable of beating anyone on their day. They will be hoping to do just that and go all the way to win this year's competition.

#  History awaits CSKA Moscow as they enter the UEFA Champions League

The Russian outfit CSKA Moscow are among the most successful clubs in their country, but they have yet to make much of an impact on the European stage. That may all be about to change this season, as they prepare to embark on their latest UEFA Champions League campaign.

They will be looking to go further than ever before, and with a talented young squad at their disposal, they have every chance of doing so. The club’s president, Evgeny Giner, is backing his players to make a real impression in Europe’s top competition, and he is confident that they can cause some serious upset in the coming weeks and months.

As ever, the Champions League will be packed with quality teams, but CSKA Moscow should not be underestimated. They have already shown that they can compete against the best sides in Europe by winning their qualifying group last season, and they will be determined to do even better this time around.

Led by captain Sergei Ignashevich and playmaker Alan Dzagoev, CSKA Moscow have a strong backbone to their team which should serve them well in the Champions League. They are likely to face some tough tests in the group stages this year, but they are more than capable of upsetting the odds and progressing to the next round.

The fans of CSKA Moscow will be hoping for a good run in the Champions League this season, and with a bit of luck they may just achieve it. Evgeny Giner is optimistic about his side’s chances, and he believes that they can go all the way to the final if they play to their potential.
